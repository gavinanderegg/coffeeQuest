# Coffee Quest

Coffee Quest is a web-based game about business and caffeine. You move using the arrow keys, and want to traverse the map from the top-left corner to the bottom-right. Each screen is a new town for you to exploit for monitary gain, but you can't business without caffine! Each deal will drain you of awakehood, and the only cure is more coffee. Coffee costs money, so you must carefully balance your actions to ensure you don't run out of cash or caffine. Financial institutions are tricky: you may gain interest, or lose money from taxation. Eventually you'll run out of energy, but the overall goal is your high score.

The game was attempted in 2011, by [Shamus Peveril](https://twitter.com/shamuspeveril) and [Gavin Anderegg](https://twitter.com/gavinanderegg), at the [Halifax Game Jam](http://halifaxgamejam.com/results.html). However, they were both lame and decided to do things like "sleep" and "relax" during their weekend. They continued to poke at the project for a bit, but it was left in an unfinshed state.

In 2014, as part of the [MindSea Hackathon](http://mindseahackathon.com/) [Chris Whalen](https://twitter.com/chris_whalen) and Gavin Anderegg revived the project and [started over from scratch](https://github.com/gavinanderegg/coffeeQuest/tree/1267dde24eb8085e1777f5f65b2fb16035f8636b). Near the end of the hackathon, Shamus also joined in. [It was presented in this state](https://github.com/gavinanderegg/coffeeQuest/tree/77ec07d464845208a7cddaa137ca9173679cef93) at the end of the hackathon. It wasn't mobile friendly, but rules are for chumps.
